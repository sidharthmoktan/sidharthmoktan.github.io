    <h3>
        I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the London School of Economics and I am on the 2024-2025 job market. <br><br> I am an applied economist with interests in Urban and Real Estate Economics, Household Finance, and Empirical Industrial Organization. <br><br> In my work, I combine measurement, theory, and structural estimation to investigate how housing market conditions and financial constraints impact householdsâ€™ economic outcomes in both the short and long run. I also study risk propagation between the housing and mortgage markets. <br><br>
