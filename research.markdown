     <br> 
         <p style="margin-left: 20px; max-width: 1000px"> <span style="font-size: 14px;"> [Draft coming soon] <a style="color: blue" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Moktan_LSE_JMP.pdf" target="_blank">[Paper Link]</a> </span><br> <strong>Abstract:</strong> 	A large and growing share of households rent from private landlords. I empirically analyze how landlords affect welfare and housing affordability by influencing rents, prices, and the allocation of houses between the rental and owner-occupied sectors in the UK in the presence of household borrowing constraints. I combine several novel datasets of UK property markets and document three key facts that point to the impact of landlords on the housing market: (i) housing quality is segmented between the rental and owner-occupied sectors, with rentals generally offering lower quality, (ii) cities with more pronounced quality segmentation tend to have higher rent-to-price ratios, and (iii) in more segmented cities landlords have fewer assets. To quantify the effect of landlords on the housing market, I develop and estimate a two-sided assignment model which features households' optimal choice of housing quality and tenure (i.e., the choice to rent or own) in the presence of borrowing constraints, landlords' profit-maximizing choice of quality to rent out, and endogenous quality segmentation and rent-to-price ratios which are determined in equilibrium. I conduct counterfactual experiments to show that differences in landlord costs of capital explain much of the variation in quality segmentation and rent-to-price ratios observed across cities.   </p>

This paper considers differences in these dynamic payoffs by the age at which the experience is accumulated. Using an administrative longitudinal employer-employee matched dataset covering 1% of full-time workers in the UK from 1980 to 2020, I find that the dynamic returns to working in big cities like London decline with the age at which the experience is accumulated in big cities. The age gradient in returns to experience persists after including worker and city fixed effects, as well as fixed effects for the age and city of pay. These results help explain why net migration into large cities is positive at younger ages and negative for older workers. </p></li>
