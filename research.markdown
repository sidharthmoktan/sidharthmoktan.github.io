     <br> 
         <p style="margin-left: 20px; max-width: 1000px"> <span style="font-size: 14px;"> <a style="color: blue" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Moktan_LSE_JMP.pdf" target="_blank">[Paper Link]</a> </span><br> <strong>Abstract:</strong> A large and growing share of households rent from private landlords. I empirically analyze how landlord supply constraints affect welfare and housing affordability by influencing rents, prices, and the allocation of houses between the rental and owner occupied sectors in the UK in the presence of household borrowing constraints. I combine several novel datasets of UK property markets and document three key facts that suggest the impact of landlord supply constraints on the housing market: (i) housing quality is segmented between the rental and owner-occupied sectors, with rentals generally offering lower quality, (ii) cities with more pronounced quality segmentation tend to have higher rent-to-price ratios, and (iii) in more segmented cities landlords have fewer assets. To quantify the effect of landlord supply constraints on the housing market, I develop and estimate a two-sided assignment model which features households’ optimal choice of housing quality and tenure (i.e., the choice to rent or own) in the presence of borrowing constraints, landlords’ profit-maximizing choice of quality to rent out, and endogenous quality segmentation and rent-to-price ratios which are determined in equilibrium. I conduct counterfactual experiments to show that differences in landlord supply constraints explain much of the variation in quality segmentation and rent-to-price ratios observed across cities. </p> </li>

<br> 
         <p style="margin-left: 20px; max-width: 1000px"> <span style="font-size: 14px;"> <a style="color: blue" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2025/the-anatomy-of-a-shock-to-residential-real-estate-the-role-of-lending" target="_blank">[Paper Link]</a> </span><br> <strong>Abstract:</strong> What is the role of lending in transmitting shocks to residential real estate? We consider this question by examining an adverse and salient shock to a segment of the property market in England and Wales. This shock, arising from a tragic event which resulted in significant loss of life, affected high-rise properties. Using comprehensive administrative data on all residential mortgage and property transactions, combined with property‑level rent data, we study responses in these markets. Consistent with the idea of credit being a ‘financial accelerator’, we document a decline in mortgage originations following the shock, with the sharpest contraction observed among first‑time buyers. We also highlight the role of cash buyers and lender size in dampening the overall impact of the shock. Additionally, the paper provides a conceptual framework that integrates multiple administrative data sets to understand how salient shocks, including those related to climate risks, may affect the property market. It offers valuable insights for financial policymakers on how these shocks propagate through credit and housing markets.  </p> </li>

This paper considers differences in these dynamic payoffs by the age at which the experience is accumulated. Using an administrative longitudinal employer-employee matched dataset covering 1% of full-time workers in the UK from 1980 to 2020, I find that the dynamic returns to working in big cities like London decline with the age at which the experience is accumulated in big cities. The age gradient in returns to experience persists after including worker and city fixed effects, as well as fixed effects for the age and city of pay. These results help explain why net migration into large cities is positive at younger ages and negative for older workers. </p></li>
<li><b style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 18px">The Impact of Local Housing Markets on Worker Sorting Across Local Labour Markets</b><p style="margin-left: 20px; max-width: 1000px">  <strong>Abstract:</strong> Young workers stand to gain the most from working in large cities. However, they are least-able to own homes in large cities due to borrowing constraints. This paper studies how the rental market facilitates labor market sorting by resolving the mismatch between the benefits of living/working in large cities and the resources required to do so. I am currently developing a spatial sorting model in which workers of varying ages and abilities with heterogeneous endowments choose the optimal city to reside and work in given moving costs. Cities differ in terms of: (i) the dynamic labor market returns they provide to workers of varying ages and abilities; and (ii) the quality of housing  accessible through renting and owning for workers with varying income and assets. Cross-city differences in housing and labor markets induces sorting of workers across cities based on age, ability and endowments. The model will be used to quantify how differences across and within local housing markets impact the sorting of workers to opportunity in different cities. Additionally the model will be used to study the effect on sorting of homeownership borrrowing constraints and housing policies which impact the functioning of the rental sector.  </p></li>

However, the final admission decision is contingent on realized high school grades which are unknown at the time of application. This paper studies how the uncertainty introduced by the reliance on both predicted and realized grades at different stages of the application process impacts students' choices. We develop a model in which students with varying levels of risk aversion choose the portfolio of university courses to apply to given their predicted grades. Risk aversion impacts the mix of safety, reach, and target schools in the portfolio. We estimate the model using rich administrative data covering the universe of college applications and admission decisions in the UK starting from 2011. The estimation allows the distribution of risk aversion to vary by observed student characteristics. This allows us to explore the role of uncertainty and risk aversion in generating heterogeneity in college choices by race, gender, and socioeconomic status. To quantify the effect of uncertainty on college choice, we consider two counterfactuals: (i) lifting the cap on the number of applications; and (ii) switching entirely to predicted grades. </p></li>
